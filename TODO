- [x] Improve performance on lookup (ids as keys in tasks)
- [x] Implement combineReducers for Immutable.js
  - [ ] Add tests
- [ ] Review tests for projects reducer
- [ ] Make action creator arguments consistent (or object based). Ugh.
  - [ ] Combine multiple actions (e.g. ADD_TASK + ADD_TASK_TO_PROJECT) so
        they're handled in the same reducer return value AND trigger a single
        render
